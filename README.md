# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Module 1 Kickstarter Excel project
This project using Excel shows charts and graphs and statistics that illustrate what makes a successful theater/play Kickstarter campaign.
Our analysis concludes that lower goals tend to be more successful.
There are 2 graphs attached which each tell a different story.  
The Outcomes Based On Goals chart suggests that for just Plays the following is true
1: Success is highest when the goal is the lowest
2: This is not a steadfast rule as the goal amount increases.  This is due to the fact that at higher goal dollar amounts there are fewer projects, so the influence of outliers is magnified and the trend line is disrupted.
One limitation of Outcomes Based On Goals is that there were no cancelled projects in the population, so no inference could be made regarding the effect relative goal size has on the chance of cancelation.
Further analysis would be useful to arrive at a standard deviation of success based on goal size ranges, as the population size at higher goals shows significant variation.
The Outcomes Based On Launch Date exapanded the population to include the entire Theater category.
This population includes canceled projects as well as several projects that were live at the time of analysis gathering.
Our primnary conclusion is that spring launch dates, especially in May,  are not only more common but have a tendency to be more successful.  Additionally, after peaking in May the number of successes trends downward throughtout the rest of the calendar year while failures remains reasonably constant.
Anecdotally, October launch dates had no canceled projects, however the failure rate increased
Further analysis would be useful to determine the impact and relevance of including spaces and musicals into the population.
Additionally, it could be helpful to apply Launch Date statistical analysis to our Goal Amount data.
